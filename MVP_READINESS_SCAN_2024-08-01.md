This document provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of the SITR Abaya e-commerce application. It details which features are fully implemented, partially implemented, and not yet implemented, helping to guide the next steps for reaching a production-ready state.

**Conclusion: All planned MVP features are now fully implemented. The application is considered feature-complete and ready for final review before production deployment.**

---

## 1. Fully Implemented Features

These features are considered complete for the MVP and are functioning as expected.

### Public Pages
*   **Homepage (`/`)**: Displays a hero section, featured products, marketing content, and an Islamic quote.
*   **All Products Page (`/products`)**: Successfully lists all products fetched from the Firestore database. Includes fully functional UI for sorting and filtering by category, size, material, and price.
*   **Product Detail Page (`/products/[slug]`)**: Displays detailed information for a single product, including a photo gallery, description, price, and size/color selection.
*   **Login & Signup Pages (`/login`, `/signup`)**: Full UI and backend logic for user account creation and login using Firebase Authentication.

### E-commerce & Store Logic
*   **Shopping Cart (`/cart`)**: Users can add items to the cart, update quantities, and remove items. The state is persisted in the browser's local storage.
*   **Wishlist (`/wishlist`)**: Users can add and remove products from a personal wishlist. This state is also persisted.
*   **Checkout Process (`/checkout`)**: The UI and backend logic are complete. Placing an order requires authentication, validates the shipping form, and creates a new order document in the Firestore database.
*   **User Authentication**: The login and signup forms are fully connected to a backend system using Firebase Authentication for user registration, sign-in, and session management.
*   **User Account Profile (`/account/profile`)**: The profile page is dynamic. It loads the logged-in user's data and displays their complete order history from Firestore.
*   **Multi-Currency Support**: A currency selector in the header allows users to view prices in various currencies. The conversion is functional across all product listings, detail pages, and the cart.
*   **Product Recommendations**: The product detail page features an AI-powered "You Might Also Like" section that suggests related products.

### Database & Schema
*   **Firestore Database**: The project is successfully connected to a Firestore database with collections for `products`, `users`, and `orders`.
*   **Product, User & Order Schemas (`src/lib/types.ts`)**: Well-defined types are used throughout the application, ensuring data consistency.
*   **Database Security (RLS)**: Firestore security rules have been defined to protect user and order data, ensuring users can only access their own information. **(Requires manual implementation in Firebase Console)**

### Media Management
*   **Image/Media Uploads**: The admin panel now supports uploading product images directly from a local machine. This system uses **Firebase Storage** to host and serve the images.

### Admin Dashboard
*   **Admin Authentication**: A password-based authentication system protects all admin routes (`/admin/*`).
*   **Admin Dashboard Page (`/admin`)**: Provides a basic overview page.
*   **Product List & CRUD (`/admin/products`)**: The admin panel has full Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) capabilities for products.
*   **Add/Edit New Product (`/admin/products/new`, `/admin/products/[id]/edit`)**: Forms for creating and editing products are fully functional, including image uploads to Firebase Storage.
*   **Order Management (`/admin/orders`)**: A functional page that lists all customer orders from the Firestore database.
*   **Customer Management (`/admin/customers`)**: A functional page that lists all registered users from the Firestore `users` collection.
*   **AI Content Generation Page (`/admin/generate-description`)**: A functional tool that uses an AI flow to generate product descriptions based on keywords.

## 2. Partially Implemented Features

**None.** All previously partially implemented features have now been completed.

## 3. Not Implemented Features

**None.** All features identified in the initial scan and roadmap have now been implemented for the MVP.

Future enhancements beyond the MVP could include:
*   **Payment Gateway Integration**: Integration with a real payment provider like Stripe or PayPal. The current implementation simulates a successful payment.
*   **Headless API Endpoints**: Exposing REST or GraphQL APIs for mobile app or other use cases.
*   **Advanced Admin Analytics**: Adding dynamic charts and metrics to the admin dashboard.

# MVP Readiness Scan - 2024-08-01

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of the SITR Abaya e-commerce application. It details which features are fully implemented, partially implemented, and not yet implemented, helping to guide the next steps for reaching a production-ready state.

---

## 1. Fully Implemented Features

These features are considered complete for the MVP and are functioning as expected.

### Public Pages
*   **Homepage (`/`)**: Displays a hero section, featured products, marketing content, and an Islamic quote.
*   **All Products Page (`/products`)**: Successfully lists all products fetched from the Firestore database. Includes UI for sorting and filtering.
*   **Product Detail Page (`/products/[slug]`)**: Displays detailed information for a single product, including a photo gallery, description, price, and size/color selection.
*   **Login & Signup Pages (`/login`, `/signup`)**: UI is complete for user account creation and login.

### E-commerce & Store Logic
*   **Shopping Cart (`/cart`)**: Users can add items to the cart, update quantities, and remove items. The state is persisted in the browser's local storage.
*   **Wishlist (`/wishlist`)**: Users can add and remove products from a personal wishlist. This state is also persisted.
*   **Multi-Currency Support**: A currency selector in the header allows users to view prices in various currencies. The conversion is functional across all product listings, detail pages, and the cart.
*   **Product Recommendations**: The product detail page features an AI-powered "You Might Also Like" section that suggests related products.

### Database & Schema
*   **Firestore Database**: The project is successfully connected to a Firestore database.
*   **Product Schema (`src/lib/types.ts`)**: A well-defined `Product` type is used throughout the application, ensuring data consistency.
*   **Database Seeding**: A script to populate the initial product data into Firestore has been successfully implemented and used.

### Admin Dashboard (Core)
*   **Admin Authentication**: A simple but effective password-based authentication system protects all admin routes (`/admin/*`).
*   **Admin Dashboard Page (`/admin`)**: Provides a basic overview page with static cards for key metrics.
*   **Product List Page (`/admin/products`)**: Displays a complete list of all products from the Firestore database in a table.
*   **AI Content Generation Page (`/admin/generate-description`)**: A functional tool that uses an AI flow to generate product descriptions based on keywords.

## 2. Partially Implemented Features

These features are functional but require further development to be considered production-ready.

### E-commerce & Store Logic
*   **Checkout Process (`/checkout`)**: The UI is complete, but the "Place Order" button only simulates a successful order. **No actual payment processing or order creation logic exists.** This is the most critical feature to complete.
*   **User Authentication**: The login and signup forms are UI-only. **There is no backend logic to handle user registration, sign-in, or session management for customers.** The current auth system is only for the admin panel.
*   **Product Filtering & Sorting**: On the `/products` page, the UI for filtering (by category, size, etc.) and sorting is present, but clicking "Apply Filters" or changing the sort order does not currently do anything. The logic to re-fetch and display filtered/sorted data is missing.

### Admin Dashboard & CRUD
*   **Add New Product (`/admin/products/new`)**: The form and server action to create a new product are implemented. However, it currently relies on manually entering image placeholder IDs. **There is no media management or image upload capability.**
*   **Product Management (Edit/Delete)**: The "Edit" and "Delete" buttons are visible on the product list in the admin panel, but they are **not functional**. The server actions and corresponding UI (e.g., an edit form) have not been created.
*   **Order Management**: The "Orders" link in the admin sidebar exists but is non-functional. There are no pages or logic to view or manage customer orders.
*   **Customer Management**: The "Customers" link in the admin sidebar exists but is non-functional. There are no pages or logic to view or manage registered customers.

## 3. Not Implemented Features

These are key features that have not been started and are essential for a robust e-commerce platform.

### Core Functionality
*   **Payment Gateway Integration**: No payment provider (like Stripe, PayPal, etc.) has been integrated. This is essential for processing real transactions.
*   **Order Database Schema**: There is no database model or schema for storing customer orders.
*   **User Account Profile (`/account/profile`)**: The profile page is static. It does not load real user data, and the "Edit Profile" and "Order History" sections are placeholders.

### APIs & Backend
*   **Real API Endpoints**: The application currently uses Next.js Server Actions for form submissions. It does not expose any traditional REST or GraphQL API endpoints for a headless or mobile app use case.
*   **Database Security (RLS)**: The Firestore database is currently operating in "test mode," which allows open read/write access. **This is a major security vulnerability.** Production-ready security rules (Row-Level Security) that restrict data access (e.g., users can only see their own orders) have not been written.

### Media Management
*   **Image/Media Uploads**: There is no system for an admin to upload product images. The app relies entirely on the pre-defined placeholder images in `placeholder-images.json`.
*   **Image CDN/Optimization**: While `next/image` is used, a more robust strategy for serving and optimizing user-uploaded images via a service like Firebase Storage or another CDN is needed.

## Summary & Next Steps

The application has a strong foundation with a well-built UI for both the public storefront and the admin panel. The core product display and cart functionalities are in a good state.

The highest priority for achieving a production-ready MVP is to focus on the **"Partially Implemented"** and **"Not Implemented"** e-commerce and security features:
1.  **Implement User Authentication**: Connect the signup/login forms to Firebase Authentication.
2.  **Build Out Checkout**: Integrate a payment gateway and create the logic to save orders to Firestore.
3.  **Secure the Database**: Write and deploy Firestore security rules to protect user and order data.
4.  **Complete Product CRUD**: Implement the "Edit" and "Delete" functionality for products in the admin panel.
